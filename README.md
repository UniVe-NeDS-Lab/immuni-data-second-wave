## The code repository for the research paper: "On the Performance and Effectiveness of Contact Tracing Apps in the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Italy"

This repository contains the code and documentation to reproduce the results of the paper (yet to be published). 

I will update the repository as soon as the paper is published on the IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems
